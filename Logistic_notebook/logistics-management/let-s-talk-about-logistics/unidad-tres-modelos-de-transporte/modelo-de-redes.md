# Network Model

### Network Model

***

Definition of networks: networks are a series of located nodes connected by arcs. The notation for describing the network is

$$
\begin{split} (N,A); \\ where: \\ N = Set\ of\ Nodes \\ A = Set\ of\ Arcs \end{split}\
$$

For example:

\\[\begin{split} N = \\{1,2,3,4,5\\} \\\ A = \\{(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,2),(4,5)\\} \end{split}\\]

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

G = nx.Graph()
G.add_nodes_from([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

A = [(1,2),(1,3),(2,3),(2,5),(3,4),(3,5),(4,2),(4,5)]
G.add_edges_from(A)

labels = {1: 'A', 2: 'B', 3: 'C', 4: 'D', 5: 'E'}

pos = nx.spring_layout(G, seed=42)
nx.draw_networkx_nodes(G, pos=pos)
nx.draw_networkx_edges(G, pos=pos)
nx.draw_networkx_labels(G, pos=pos, labels=labels)

plt.show()
```

With each associated network, some type of flow, traffic, processes, etc., will be described. It is called a directed or oriented arc if it allows positive flow and zero flow in the direction of the arc.

A path is the succession of distinct arcs that connects two nodes passing through other nodes, regardless of the direction of flow of each arc. A directed network has all its arcs directed.

A connected network is one in which every two distinct nodes are connected by at least one path. A tree is a connected network that can easily be the connected network of all nodes, but with no cycles.

### Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithm

***

The minimum spanning algorithm connects the nodes of a network, directly or indirectly, with the minimum possible length of the connecting branches. A possible use of this algorithm is in the design of distribution networks.

The most economical system design will be the one that minimizes the total distance of the created paths.
Another definition: A minimum spanning tree is a special type of tree that minimizes the lengths (or money) of the tree‚Äôs edges. An example is a cable company wanting to minimize the cost of connecting homes.

Procedure:

Let $$N=\{1,2,...n\}$$, en conjunto de  nodos en la Red.

$$
C_k=Conjunto\ de\ nodos\ que\ se\ han\ Conectado\ en \ forma\ permanente\ en\ la\ iteracion\ K \\ \bar{C_k} = Conjunto\ de\ nodos\ que\ faltan\ por\ conectar.
$$

**Step Zero: The set:

$$
C_0=ùõ≥\ y \\ \bar{C_0} =N
$$

1. Start with any node in the set $$\bar{C_0}$$ not yet connected and set $$C_1=\{i\}$$, con lo que $$\bar{C_1}=N-\{i\}$$, igualar a K=2
2. **paso general K,** select a node j in the unconnected set $$\bar{C_{k-1}}$$ that produces the shortest arc to a node in the connected set $$C_{k-1}$$ enlazando j permanently connecting $$C_{k-1}$$ and put it out of $$\bar{C_{k-1}}$$

$$
C_k=C_{k-1}+\{j\}, C_k = \bar{C_{k-1}}-\{j\}
$$

* when $$\bar{C_{k}}$$ is zero or empty, stop; otherwise, set $$K=k+1$$ and repeat the process.

Given the following table:

|       | A | B | C | D | E |
| ----- | - | - | - | - | - |
| **A** | 0 | 1 | 4 | 6 | 2 |
| **B** | 1 | 0 | 2 | - | 2 |
| **C** | 4 | 2 | 0 | 5 | 2 |
| **D** | 6 | - | 5 | 0 | 4 |
| **E** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 4 | 0 |

Use Prim‚Äôs and Kruskal‚Äôs algorithms and compare.

#### Theoretical Model According to Prim‚Äôs Algorithm:


Initialization: Select an arbitrary node as the root of the tree. Step-by-step construction:

1. At each step, add the shortest edge that connects a node inside the tree with one outside the tree.

2. Select the node closest to the current tree and add the edge connecting that node to the tree.

3. Termination: Repeat step 2 until all nodes are included in the tree.

#### Theoretical Model According to Kruskal‚Äôs Algorithm:

Edge ordering: Sort all edges in non-decreasing order of weight. Step-by-step construction:

1. At each step, select the shortest edge that does not form a cycle with the edges already selected.
2. Add this edge to the minimum spanning tree.
3. Termination: Repeat step 2 until (n-1) edges have been selected, where (n) is the number of nodes in the system.
