# Route Desing Using Python

Linear programming is a mathematical technique used to optimize a linear objective, subject to linear constraints. In route design, it allows you to model and solve problems that seek to minimize costs or total travel time while respecting capacity and time constraints. This technique helps determine the best combination of decision variables such as routes to be taken, number of vehicles, and delivery sequence, ensuring that resources are used efficiently and effectively.

Route optimization represents one of the most common challenges in logistics operations management. Mathematical models provide a systematic framework for addressing these problems, enabling more informed and efficient decision-making. Some of the most commonly used models are described below.

**Programming Model for Solving Routing Problems**

Routing problems are common challenges in transportation and logistics optimization. These problems may involve finding the most efficient route to deliver goods, planning travel itineraries, or minimizing transportation costs. An effective approach to addressing these problems is the use of programming models.

#### Types of Routing Problems

1. **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**: Seeks to determine the shortest route that allows a set of cities to be visited only once and return to the starting point.
2. **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**: Focuses on finding optimal routes for a fleet of vehicles that must meet a series of demands from a central depot.
3. **Delivery and Collection Routing Problems**: Involves not only the delivery of goods but also the collection of products or packaging for recycling.

### ROUTE DESIGN USING PYTHON.[#](../../../../logistics/let-s-talk-about-logistics/unidad-tres-modelos-de-transporte/diseno-de-rutas-con-python/broken-reference/)

There are numerous libraries and algorithms available that simplify the route design process in Python. These tools are used to optimize and plan efficient routes in various applications, such as vehicle fleet management, freight delivery, trip planning, and many others.

Notable libraries include NetworkX, which provides data structures and algorithms for graph and network analysis. There is also GeoPandas, which extends Pandas' capabilities by allowing the handling and analysis of geospatial data. Another popular option is OSRM (Open Source Routing Machine), which offers a server and client library for generating routes using OpenStreetMap data.

On the other hand, route optimization algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm, the A\* (A-star) algorithm, and metaheuristic optimization algorithms can be used to find optimal routes based on various constraints and costs. These algorithms are essential for applications requiring high efficiency in route planning.

workers = range(3)
tasks = range(3)
x = pulp.LpVariable.dicts("x", [(i, j) for i in workers for j in tasks], cat='Binary')

# Objective function
prob += pulp.lpSum(costs[i][j] * x[(i, j)] for i in workers for j in tasks)

# Constraints
for i in workers:
prob += pulp.lpSum(x[(i, j)] for j in tasks) == 1

for j in tasks:
prob += pulp.lpSum(x[(i, j)] for i in workers) == 1

# Solve the problem
prob.solve()

# Print the results
print("Status:", pulp.LpStatus[prob.status])
for v in prob.variables():

### Example 1:

MG Auto has three plants: in Los Angeles, Detroit, and New Orleans; and two main distribution centers in Denver and Miami. The capacities of the three plants during the next quarter will be 1,000, 1,500, and 1,200 cars. Quarterly demand at the two distribution centers is 2,300 and 1,400 cars. The mileage between the factories and the distribution centers

* The shipping company charges 8 cents per mile per car. The transportation cost per car, on the different routes, is rounded up to the nearest dollar.

TABLE 1

|             | Denver | Mimami |
| ----------- | ------ | ------ |
| Los Angeles | 1000   | 2690   |
| Detroit     | 1250   | 1350   |
| New Orleans | 1275   | 850    |

TABLE 2

|                | Denver(1) | Mimami(2) |
| -------------- | --------- | --------- |
| Los Angeles(1) | 80        | 215       |
| Detroit(2)     | 100       | 108       |
| New Orleans(3) | 102       | 68        |

**Solving:**

**Decision variables:**

* \\(x\_{ij}\\): Number of cars to be transported from plant \\(i\\) to distribution center \\(j\\).

**Objective function:**

* Minimize the total transportation cost, given by:

\\\[\text{Min } Z = 0.08 \sum\limits\_{i=1}^{3}\sum\limits\_{j=1}^{2}x\_{ij}d\_{ij}\\]

* Where \\(d\_{ij}\\) is the distance in kilometers between plant \\(i\\) and distribution center \\(j\\), according to Table 1.

**Constraints:**

* Plant capacity: $\\(\sum\limits\_{j=1}^{2}x\_{ij} \leq c\_i âˆ€\ i = 1, 2, 3\\)$
* Where \\(c\_i\\) is the capacity of plant \\(i\\).
* Distribution center demand: $\\(\sum\limits\_{i=1}^{3}x\_{ij} \geq d\_j\ âˆ€\ j = 1, 2\\)$
* Where \\(d\_j\\) is the demand of distribution center \\(j\\), according to the statement.
* Non-negativity constraints: $\\(x\_{ij} \geq 0\ âˆ€\ i = 1, 2, 3\ and\ j = 1, 2\\)$
* _Also, the decision variables must be integers, since fractions of cars cannot be transported._

**Solving with Python and the PuLp library:**[**#**](../../../../logistics/let-s-talk-about-logistics/unidad-tres-modelos-de-transporte/diseno-de-rutas-con-python/broken-reference/)

```python
import pulp

# Create a minimization problem
problem = pulp.LpProblem("Transportation", pulp.LpMinimize)

# Create the decision variables
x11 = pulp.LpVariable("Los Angeles to Denver", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x12 = pulp.LpVariable("Los Angeles to Miami", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x21 = pulp.LpVariable("Detroit to Denver", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x22 = pulp.LpVariable("Detroit to Miami", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x31 = pulp.LpVariable("New Orleans to Denver", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')
x32 = pulp.LpVariable("New Orleans to Miami", lowBound=0, cat='Integer')

# Define the objective function
problem += 0.08 * (1000*x11 + 2690*x12 + 1250*x21 + 1350*x22 + 1275*x31 + 850*x32)

# Define the supply and demand constraints
problem += x11 + x12 <= 2300, "Supply "Angeles"
problem += x21 + x22 <= 1500, "Detroit Offer"
problem += x31 + x32 <= 2000, "New Orleans Offer"
problem += x11 + x21 + x31 >= 2300, "Denver Lawsuit"
problem += x12 + x22 + x32 >= 1400, "Miami Lawsuit"

# Solve the problem
problem.solve()

# Print the result
print("Status:", pulp.LpStatus[problem.status])
print("Total transportation cost: $", round(pulp.value(problem.objective), 2))

for variable in problem.variables(): 
print(variable.name, "=", variable.varValue)
```

#### Example 2:

In this model, we have three origins (\\(O\_1\\), \\(O\_2\\), and \\(O\_3\\)) and four destinations (\\(D\_1\\), \\(D\_2\\), \\(D\_3\\), and \\(D\_4\\)), and the table shows the transportation costs from each origin to each destination. The objective is to determine the optimal allocation of products to destinations, minimizing the total transportation cost.

| ORIGEN     | \\(D\_1\\) | \\(D\_2\\) | \\(D\_3\\) | \\(D\_4\\) |
| ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| \\(O\_1\\) | 4          | 5          | 2          | 7          |
| \\(O\_2\\) | 3          | 6          | 8          | 2          |
| \\(O\_3\\) | 9          | 4          | 1          | 3          |

**Solving the model:**

The objective function of this model is expressed as:

\begin{equation\*} \text{minimize} Z = \sum\_{i=1}^{3}\sum\_{j=1}^{4}c\_{ij}x\_{ij} \end{equation\*}

Where:

\\(Z\\): represents the total transportation cost.

\\(c\_{ij}\\): is the cost of transporting a unit from origin \\(i\\) to destination \\(j\\).

\\(x\_{ij}\\): is the number of units transported from origin \\(i\\) to destination \\(j\\).

Capacity constraints are expressed as:

```markdown
\begin{align*} \sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{1j} &\leq 60
\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{2j} &\leq 70
\sum_{j=1}^{4} x_{3j} &\leq 80 \end{align*}
```

**Where:**

The constraint \\(\sum\_{j=1}^{4} x\_{ij} \leq C\_i\\) indicates that the total quantity of products shipped from source \\(i\\) cannot exceed its maximum capacity \\(C\_i\\). Demand constraints are expressed as:

```markdown
\begin{align*} \sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i1} &\geq 50
\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i2} &\geq 70
\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i3} &\geq 80
\sum_{i=1}^{3} x_{i4} &\geq 30 \end{align*}
```

**Where:**

* The constraint \\(\sum\_{i=1}^{3} x\_{ij} \geq D\_j\\) indicates that the total quantity of products shipped to destination \\(j\\) must be at least equal to its demand \\(D\_j\\)
