# Session 8: Performance Management and Final Project

## Defining and Calculating Critical Logistics KPIs

\
Effective logistics management requires monitoring performance to ensure strategic goals are met. Critical logistics Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are crucial for monitoring and improving supply chain performance, allowing managers to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of their processes. A well-structured logistics control system compares actual performance against established goals to trigger corrective action when necessary.

1. On-Time Shipping/Delivery •&#x20;

This KPI measures the percentage of orders delivered to customers on the promised date and time. From the customer's perspective, this is one of the most critical elements of service, reflecting the reliability of the logistics system. Failures in this area, such as delayed deliveries, are among the most common customer complaints and a key factor in carrier selection.

Calculation:\
◦ Key Components:\


Orders Delivered On-Time: Shipments that arrive at the customer's destination within the agreed-upon time window (date and time).\


Total Number of Orders Shipped: The total shipments made during the measurement period.\

Strategic Importance: A high on-time delivery rate improves customer satisfaction and loyalty, which are crucial for retention and sales growth. It is fundamental for operations that rely on precise scheduling, such as Just-In-Time (JIT) systems

## Order Fill Rate&#x20;

Definition: Order fill rate is the fraction of customer orders that are completely filled from available inventory on the first attempt, without incurring backorders or partial shipments. It is a direct measure of product availability and the effectiveness of inventory service levels. A high fill rate is a key component of customer service.&#x20;

Calculation

There are two primary variations:&#x20;

1\. By Order (Order Fill Rate): Measures the completeness of entire orders.&#x20;

2\. By Line (Line Fill Rate): Measures completeness at the level of individual items within orders.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Strategic Importance: A high fill rate is essential to avoid lost sales, as out-of-stock situations often lead customers to a competitor. This KPI directly impacts revenue and the customer's perception of the company's reliability.

## Order Accuracy

Definition: This indicator measures the percentage of orders that are processed, picked, and shipped without errors. Errors can include shipping the wrong product, incorrect quantity, damaged goods, or incorrect documentation. Accurate documentation is a key element of logistics customer service.\


Calculation:\


Key Components:\
\- Orders without Errors: Those that perfectly match the original customer order in terms of product, quantity, condition, and documentation.\
\- Strategic Importance: Order errors generate significant additional costs through reverse logistics (returns), reshipments, and administrative labor to correct the issue.&#x20;

They also negatively affect customer satisfaction and trust. Improving accuracy is fundamental for operational efficiency and profitability.
