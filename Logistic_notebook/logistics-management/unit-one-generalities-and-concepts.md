### Introduction to Logistics and Supply Chain Management

Logistics and supply chain management play a crucial role in today's business world. They encompass the planning and management of all activities involved in sourcing, procurement, conversion, and logistics management. This introduction covers key concepts and the significance of efficient supply chain systems in optimizing operations and meeting customer demands.

### 1.1 Pre-Knowledge Analysis

Logistics is defined as the part of the supply chain process that plans, implements, and controls the efficient and effective flow and storage of goods and services, along with related information, from the point of origin to the point of consumption, to meet customer requirements

SCM is seen as the systematic and strategic coordination of traditional business functions and tactics across these functions within a company and among all participating companies in the supply chain, aiming to improve long-term performance for individual firms and the chain as a whole. Some experts distinguish between SCM and logistics, while others use the terms interchangeably, but for practical purposes, the sources often refer to integrated business logistics management and SCM interchangeably, focusing on managing product and service flows efficiently and effectively

The overarching mission is to "deliver the right goods or services to the right place, at the right time, and in the desired conditions, while achieving the greatest contribution to the company"
{% endhint %}

Logistics specifically creates time and place value in products, primarily through transportation, information flow, and inventories, while manufacturing creates form value and marketing often manages possession value.

### Evolution of SCM

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Term" %}
The term "Supply Chain Management" was introduced in 1982 and gained notoriety in the mid-1990s due to technology, e-commerce, and process reengineering.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="History" %}
Historically, logistics activities were often handled separately, but the field evolved towards coordinated management of related activities, recognizing that logistics adds value to products and services. This shift moved from fragmented activities to an integrated approach over time.

### Decision-Making Phases in SCM

Successful SCM requires decisions related to the flow of information, products, and funds, all aimed at increasing the supply chain surplus. These decisions are categorized into three phases based on frequency and impact period:&#x20;

* **Strategic (or Design) Phase:** Long-term decisions (several years) concerning the configuration of the supply chain network, including defining the roles, locations, and capacities of facilities, and allocating markets. These decisions set constraints for subsequent planning phases and consider long-term demand, macroeconomic, and financial uncertainties.&#x20;
* **Planning Phase:** Medium-term decisions (quarterly to annually) where the supply chain configuration is fixed, and the goal is to maximize the supply chain surplus within those constraints. This includes production plans, outsourcing, inventory policies, and marketing promotions, incorporating demand, exchange rate, and competition uncertainty.&#x20;
* **Operational Phase:** Short-term decisions (weekly or daily) focused on managing incoming customer orders as effectively as possible, given the fixed configuration and defined planning policies. This involves allocating inventory or production to specific orders, scheduling deliveries, and generating picking lists.

### Key Directives (Drivers) of Supply Chain Performance

Six key directives determine the performance of any supply chain, balancing responsiveness against efficiency:

<details>

<summary>Facilities</summary>

The "where" of the supply chain, locations where inventory is transformed (manufacturing) or stored (warehousing). Decisions involve location, capacity, and market allocation

</details>

<details>

<summary>Inventory</summary>

The "what" is moved along the supply chain. It acts as a buffer against uncertainty and demand variability. Decisions involve stock levels (raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods), safety stock, and reorder quantities.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Transportation</summary>

The "how" inventory is moved. Involves balancing the cost of transport (efficiency) with the speed of delivery (responsiveness). Decisions include mode selection (rail, truck, air, ship, pipeline), network design, and routing.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Information</summary>

The foundation upon which managers make decisions across functions and companies. It enables visibility, analysis, and execution of actions to improve performance. Critical for forecasting, planning, and coordinating processes.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Sourcing </summary>

Decisions related to acquiring goods and services from suppliers. It involves supplier selection, contract design, and risk management.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Pricing  </summary>

How a company charges for goods and services, influencing customer demand and company profitability. Revenue management techniques aim to maximize profit by segmenting customers and differentiating prices.

### Uncertainty and Risk Management

\
Uncertainty is a fundamental aspect of SCM, influencing demand, supply, prices, and exchange rates. Forecasts are always wrong and must include an expected value and a measure of error to plan for contingencies.\


Risk management is crucial in SCM design and operations. Risks can be operational (supplier failures, quality issues, production interruptions, capacity fluctuations), financial (exchange rates, accounts receivable), or related to intellectual property and forecasting inaccuracies. Strategies include redundancy (e.g., safety stock, backup systems) and flexibility.

### Computational Intelligence (CI) and AI in SCM 

CI methods, often nature-inspired metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, swarm intelligence, neural networks, fuzzy logic), are used to solve complex logistics and SCM problems without extensive problem-specific knowledge.\


These methods are particularly useful for optimization and search problems in areas like transportation planning (vehicle routing), inventory management, and facility location.\


{% hint style="warning" %}
AI and Machine Learning are becoming increasingly important for coping with massive data collections (volume, velocity, variety, veracity) and performing classification and regression tasks in SCM. They are used for pattern recognition in performance reports and suggesting corrective actions
