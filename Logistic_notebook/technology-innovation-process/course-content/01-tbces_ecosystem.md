### 🧠 Theoretical Content

#### 1. What is a Technology-Based Company (TBC)?

A TBC is an organization whose core business model revolves around exploiting scientific and technological capabilities. They transform research and development (R\&D) results into innovative products, processes, or services with high value-added.

#### 2. Minciencias Project Typologies

Minciencias classifies research and innovation projects to allocate funding and measure impact:

```

#### 3. Technology Readiness Level (TRL)

The TRL scale (developed by NASA) measures the maturity of a technology from ideological concept to market-ready product.

        T2["TRL 2: Technology concept formulated"]
        T3["TRL 3: Experimental proof of concept"]
    end

    subgraph "Phase 2: Development (TRL 4-6)"
        T4["TRL 4: Tech validated in lab"]
        T5["TRL 5: Tech validated in relevant environment"]
        T6["TRL 6: Prototype demonstrated in relevant environment"]
    end

    subgraph "Phase 3: Deployment (TRL 7-9)"
        T7["TRL 7: System prototype demo in operational environment"]
        T8["TRL 8: System complete and qualified"]
        T9["TRL 9: Actual system proven in operational environment"]
    end

### 🛠️ Class Activity: Business Challenge Diagnosis

**Goal**: Define the starting point of your technology project.

{% stepper %}
{% step %}
#### Company/Challenge Selection

Identify a company or specific industrial problem.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Initial TRL Definition

Where does the solution start? Are you starting from TRL 1 (just an idea) or TRL 3-4 (some basic proof of concept exists)?
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
#### Justification

Write a technical paragraph justifying the chosen starting TRL.
{% endstep %}
{% endstepper %}

***

### 📚 Assignments

* Formulate the initial work teams (3-4 members).
* Document the Industrial Problem and the Initial TRL for the next session.
