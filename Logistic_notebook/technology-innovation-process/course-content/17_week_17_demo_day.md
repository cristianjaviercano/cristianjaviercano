# 17\_Week\_17\_Demo\_Day

{% hint style="info" %}
## 🎯 Session Objectives

* **Present** the completely validated technological solution to the jury.
* **Deliver** a professional Tech Pitch integrating Strategy, Development, and Business.
* **Receive** the official Cut 3 grade (40% of the final course mark) and conclude the course.

### 📝 Evaluation Structure: The Demo Day

The final evaluation (Cut 3) is comprehensive. It evaluates not just the technical build (which was verified in Cut 2), but its integration into a viable business operation with real-world validation.

#### Weighting within the Course: 40%

{% step %}
### 1. The Tech Stand (The Demo)

* Teams will set up a physical or virtual stand for their project.
* **The Prototype**: The MVP must be on display. If physical (Arduino), it must be powered on. If software (Python/Anylogic modeling), a laptop must be running the live demo.
* **Real-World Evidence**: You must display the video/data gathered during your Week 12 Pilot Test in the real industrial environment.
{% endstep %}

{% step %}
### 2. The Pitch Presentation

* **Time limit**: Strict 7-minute pitch in front of the jury (Instructors, SILOGÉ representatives, external guests).
* **Format**: Using the polished 10-slide Tech Deck from Week 16.
* **Defense**: A 5-minute Q\&A session where the jury will aggressively question the technology's scalability, IP strategy, and business robustness.
