# Technology Definition and development.

Let's explore these fundamental concepts of research and innovation management together. Since these topics are interconnected—forming the framework for how science translates into value within the Colombian ecosystem—we can look at them as parts of a single lifecycle.

Minciencias (The Ministry of Science, Technology, and Innovation) uses these definitions to categorize efforts, measure progress, and identify the vehicles for commercialization.<br>

* Minciencias Project Typologies: We can examine how projects are classified into Scientific Research, Technological Development, and Innovation, and what distinguishes them.
* EBT (Technology-Based Companies): We can define what exactly constitutes an _Empresa de Base Tecnológica_ (often called a Spin-off or Start-up in English contexts) and how they differ from traditional businesses.
* The TRL Framework: We can analyze the _Technology Readiness Level_ scale, originally from NASA and adopted by Minciencias, to measure how close a technology is to the market.

## Definition of technology:

> Technology is fundamentally the application of scientific knowledge for practical purposes. It acts as the bridge that translates abstract understanding into real-world utility.

For an industrial engineer, it is helpful to view technology not just as "gadgets," but as a spectrum consisting of two main categories:

* Hard Technology: Tangible components, such as machinery, hardware, or materials (e.g., a robotic arm on an assembly line).
* Soft Technology: Intangible assets, such as methodologies, processes, algorithms, or organizational systems (e.g., a Six Sigma quality control process).

Understanding this distinction is crucial because Minciencias funds and classifies projects in both categories.

In your own words, what is the main difference between the goal of "Science" and the goal of "Technology"?

## Technological Surveillance&#x20;

Technological Surveillance (often referred to as Competitive Technical Intelligence) acts as the radar for R\&D strategy. It allows an organization to anticipate changes rather than merely react to them.

At its core, this discipline relies on mapping the Technology Life Cycle, which is famously modeled by the S-Curve.

This logistic curve suggests that the performance or adoption of a technology follows a predictable path:

1. Emergence: Slow progress, high investment, low return.
2. Growth: Rapid improvement and adoption; the "dominant design" emerges.
3. Maturity: Performance hits a physical limit (asymptote); returns diminish.
