# Soft Simulation: Anylogic

## Simulation software

#### Why use simulation software?

1. **Accuracy and efficiency**: They allow complex scenarios to be modeled without resorting to costly physical experiments.
2. **Time and resource savings**: They facilitate rapid iterations and adjustments to the simulated model rather than physical prototypes.
3. **Risk prevention**: They make it possible to identify errors before applying them to real-world environments, minimizing potential risks.
4. **Process optimization**: They contribute to the analysis and continuous improvement of processes by identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
5. **Data visualization**: They offer tools to visually represent simulated data, improving the understanding and communication of results.
