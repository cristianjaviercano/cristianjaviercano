# Soft Simulation: Anylogic

## Soft Simulation: Anylogic

### Simulation software

**Why use simulation software?**

1. **Accuracy and efficiency**: They allow complex scenarios to be modeled without resorting to costly physical experiments.
2. **Time and resource savings**: They facilitate rapid iterations and adjustments to the simulated model rather than physical prototypes.
3. **Risk prevention**: They make it possible to identify errors before applying them to real-world environments, minimizing potential risks.
4. **Process optimization**: They contribute to the analysis and continuous improvement of processes by identifying bottlenecks and areas for improvement.
5. **Data visualization**: They offer tools to visually represent simulated data, improving the understanding and communication of results.

## How to Create a Simulation Model in AnyLogic

AnyLogic is a versatile simulation software widely used for modeling complex systems in areas such as logistics, manufacturing, healthcare, and business processes. This guide provides a step-by-step approach for creating a simulation model in AnyLogic, from conceptualization to execution and analysis.

***

### 1. Define the Problem and Objectives

* **Identify the system** you want to simulate (e.g., a factory, hospital, supply chain).
* **Clarify the goals** of the simulation (e.g., reduce wait times, optimize resource allocation, estimate throughput).
* **Determine key performance indicators (KPIs)** to measure (e.g., queue length, utilization, lead time).

***

### 2. Conceptualize the System

* **Map out processes**: Draw a flow diagram of how entities (e.g., customers, products) move through the system.
* **Identify resources**: List machines, staff, transport vehicles, etc.
* **Define entities and their attributes**: What objects flow through your model? What data do they carry?
* **Specify logic and rules**: How do decisions, routing, and priorities work in your system?

***

### 3. Set Up the AnyLogic Project

1. **Open AnyLogic** and create a new model via `File > New > Model`.
2. **Name your model** and set the location for saving.
3. **Familiarize yourself** with the AnyLogic interface:
   * **Palette** (blocks and agents)
   * **Project Browser**
   * **Properties Window**
   * **Canvas**

***

### 4. Build the Model Structure

#### For Process-Based (Discrete-Event) Models

1. **Drag Process Modeling Library blocks** (e.g., Source, Queue, Delay, Seize, Release, Sink) onto the canvas.
2. **Connect blocks** in the order that entities should flow.
3. **Configure block parameters**:
   * Arrival rates in `Source`
   * Delay times in `Delay`
   * Resource pools in `Seize`/`Release`
   * Service logic in `Queue`

#### For Agent-Based or System Dynamics Models

* **Define agent types** and their behaviors.
* **Drag relevant libraries** (e.g., Agent, Population, Statechart) onto the canvas.
* **Set up interactions, states, and transitions** as required.

***

### 5. Input Data and Parameterization

* **Set input parameters** (e.g., arrival rates, service times, resource capacities) via properties or parameter blocks.
* **Import data** if needed (from Excel, databases, etc.).
* **Define probability distributions** for random events (e.g., exponential, normal).

***

### 6. Add Logic and Customization

* Use **Actions** (Java code snippets) for custom logic (e.g., conditional routing, statistics).
* Define **variables and parameters** for flexibility.
* Add **statecharts** for agent behavior if using agent-based modeling.

***

### 7. Set Up Visualization and Animation (Optional)

* Add **charts, plots, and histograms** for real-time data visualization.
* Use **animation shapes** (e.g., rectangles, icons) to represent entities and resources.
* Add **labels and legends** for clarity.

***

### 8. Run and Debug the Model

* Click the **Run** button to start the simulation.
* Use **breakpoints** and **tracing** to debug logic.
* Adjust parameters and observe model behavior.

***

### 9. Collect and Analyze Results

* Use **built-in statistics**: Many blocks automatically collect performance metrics.
* Add **custom data collection** (e.g., DataSets, Output files).
* Analyze **outputs** using charts, tables, and exported data.

***

### 10. Experimentation and Optimization

* Use the **Experiment** features (e.g., Parameter Variation, Optimization, Monte Carlo) to explore scenarios.
* Automate multiple runs with different settings.
* Identify optimal solutions or robust policies.

***

### 11. Document and Share the Model

* Add **descriptive comments** and documentation within the model.
* Use **AnyLogic Cloud** or export features to share models and results with stakeholders.

***

### Example: Simple Queue Model

1. **Source** → **Queue** → **Seize (Resource)** → **Delay** → **Release** → **Sink**
2. Set entity arrival rate in `Source` (e.g., exponential interarrival time).
3. Define service time in `Delay`.
4. Set up a resource pool (e.g., "servers") in `Seize` and `Release`.
5. Run the model and observe statistics like queue length and waiting time.

***

### Additional Tips

* Start simple, then add complexity incrementally.
* Validate each part of the model before moving on.
* Use version control for larger projects.
* Refer to AnyLogic’s [documentation](https://help.anylogic.com/) and [community](https://www.anylogic.com/resources/support/) for help and examples.
