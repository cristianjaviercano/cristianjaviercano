# Exercise Blocks Chapter Two

### **Question Block**

1.  **Probability Calculation:** A production process has a defect rate of 5%. If a sample of 10 units is taken:
    1. What is the probability that exactly one unit is defective? (Use Binomial)
    2. What is the probability that at least two units are defective?

2.  **Expected Value and Variance:** The service time at a workstation follows a uniform distribution between 5 and 15 minutes.  
    1. Calculate the expected service time and its standard deviation.

3. **Distribution Selection:** For each of the following scenarios in a logistics system, propose an appropriate probability distribution and justify your choice:
    1. Number of trucks arriving at a distribution center in a period of one hour.
    2. Time it takes an operator to prepare an order, knowing that the minimum time is 3 minutes, the maximum is 10 minutes, and the most frequent is 5 minutes.
    3. The proportion of orders delivered on time.
    4. The time until a new forklift experiences its first major breakdown, assuming breakdowns occur at a constant rate.

4. **Central Limit Theorem:** If the time to complete each of 25 independent tasks in a project has a mean of 4 hours and a standard deviation of 1 hour (normal distribution assumed):
    1. What can you say about the distribution of the total time to complete the project?  
        1. Estimate the probability that the project takes more than 105 hours.

5. **Goodness of Fit:** 100 observations of the time between arrivals to a system have been collected. It is suspected that they follow an exponential distribution.  
    1. Describe the steps you would follow to verify this hypothesis using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  
        1. What would you do if the test rejects the hypothesis?

### Discussion Questions

1. Explain the fundamental difference between a discrete random variable and a continuous one, and how this affects the way their probabilities are described.
2. Why is the concept of independence of random variables important when building a simulation model of a production line with multiple machines?
3. If a goodness-of-fit test for a Normal distribution applied to process time data yields a p-value of 0.25, how would you interpret this result? Does it mean the data are normally distributed? Why or why not?
4. Discuss the limitations of using only the mean to describe a random variable in a simulation model. Why is it important to also consider the variance or other measures of dispersion?
