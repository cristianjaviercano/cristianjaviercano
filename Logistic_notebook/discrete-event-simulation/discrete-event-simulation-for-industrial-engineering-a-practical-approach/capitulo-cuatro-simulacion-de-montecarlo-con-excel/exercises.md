1. General Knowledge Questions on Process Simulation. **(**_**Worth: 0.5 points per question.)**_
1. Explain the differences (do not define) between static and dynamic models, and give an example of each.
2. Build an algorithm that explains how you would recreate the behavior of a continuous uniform random variable using Monte Carlo Simulation.

### CASE STUDIES

#### Shoe Factory

Within the shoemaking process, it can be divided into two stages: cutting and assembly. The units (pairs of shoes) arrive at station 1 such that the time between arrivals is normally distributed with a mean of 1 minute and 30 seconds and a deviation of 20 seconds. The first stage depends on the type of cut; the company currently has three types of cuts, and they are all made on the same machine. The second stage is performed by a machine with a normally distributed operating time with a mean of 3 minutes and a deviation of 1 minute. Simulate the production of 100 pairs of shoes. Determine the average time in the system and the average waiting time for the units in the system.

| Type | % Production | Operating Time |
| ------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type 1 | 50% | 2 min |
| Type 2 | 30% | between 45 seconds and one minute |
| Type 3 | 20% | <p>Normal distribution with a mean of 2 minutes and a standard deviation of 20 seconds</p> |

2. Identify the system elements to be simulated, their dependencies, and interactions. **(Value: 1.5 points)**
1. Construct a flowchart that, in addition to describing the sequence of process activities, lists the entities and locations, input and output variables, and identifies the events in the system.
3. Build the MC Simulation model in Excel, recreating the behavior of variables and the interactions of the different system elements. Determine the average waiting time and the average time in the system. **(Value: 2.5 points)**
