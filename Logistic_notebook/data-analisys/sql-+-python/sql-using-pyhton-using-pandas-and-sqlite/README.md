Learn to Use SQL in Python and Master Data Like an Expert

An Essential Talk for Industrial Engineers of the Future

### The Industrial Engineer in the Data Era

"Data is the new oil" (Clive Humby). For Industrial Engineering, this means a revolution in process optimization, evidence-based decision-making, continuous improvement, and Industry 4.0.

The contemporary industrial engineer plays a pivotal role in the development and operation of complex systems that are integral to various industries. Their responsibilities extend beyond mere design and management; they are also tasked with the intricate process of analyzing and interpreting the vast amounts of data these systems produce. This requires a keen analytical mindset and a deep understanding of data science principles to transform raw data into actionable insights. By leveraging advanced tools and methodologies, industrial engineers can optimize systems for improved efficiency, reduced costs, and increased productivity. This critical function not only enhances system performance but also drives innovation and competitive advantage in the industrial landscape.
