# Inventory Indicators or KPIs

## Inventory KPIs

Inventory KPIs are vital metrics that help manage and optimize a company's inventory. Below are some of the most important KPIs to consider:

### 1. Inventory Turnover

Inventory turnover is a key indicator in business management that measures the number of times a business's inventory is sold and replenished over a specific period. This ratio is crucial for understanding how efficiently a company manages its stock. A high inventory turnover value typically indicates good inventory management, as it suggests that products are selling quickly compared to the amount of inventory held.

This can also reduce costs associated with storing and maintaining inventory while improving cash flow. Therefore, a high inventory turnover is a positive sign of a company's efficient operations, ensuring that items do not become obsolete but are aligned with market demand.

$$
\text{Inventory Turnover} = \frac{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}{\text{Average Inventory}}
$$

### 2. Days Inventory on Hand (DIH)

This KPI, known as "Days Inventory on Hand" (DIH), measures the average time that inventory remains in the warehouse before being sold. This indicator is critical for evaluating the efficiency of inventory management and product turnover within the company. A lower DIH is desirable as it suggests that products are selling quickly, which can be indicative of good inventory management, high demand for the product, or a combination of both. Conversely, a higher DIH can indicate problems such as excess stock, lack of demand, or inefficiencies in sales or distribution processes. Closely monitoring this KPI allows companies to optimize their operations, reduce storage costs, and improve cash flow.

$$
\text{DIH} = \frac{\text{Average Inventory} \times 365}{\text{Cost of Goods Sold}}
$$

### 3. Inventory Accuracy

This indicator assesses the accuracy of inventory records by comparing them with the existing physical inventory. This is achieved by identifying discrepancies between documented data and what is actually available in the warehouse. Accuracy is calculated as a percentage, reflecting how well the records match reality. A high level of accuracy is indicative of an efficient inventory management system, where errors and omissions are minimal. By conducting periodic audits, you can maintain rigorous control and ensure that any mismatches are corrected in a timely manner, thereby optimizing operational efficiency and reducing unnecessary losses due to inventory errors.

$$
\text{Inventory Accuracy} = \left(\frac{\text{Correct Quantity}}{\text{Recorded Quantity}}\right) \times 100%
$$

### 4. Service Level

**Evaluating Customer Responsiveness**

Service level refers to an organization's ability to effectively meet its customers' demands and expectations regarding the availability of products and services. A key focus for achieving a high level of service is ensuring that there are no delays in delivering products to customers, which will build trust and satisfaction.

When a company maintains a high level of service, it implies that it has an efficient inventory management and logistics system, ensuring that products are available to customers at the right time. This approach not only improves the customer experience but also strengthens the company's reputation in the market by demonstrating its commitment to quality and efficiency.

To achieve an optimal level of service, organizations must implement demand analysis, supply planning, and process optimization strategies. These actions ensure an accurate projection of market needs, avoiding both shortages and excess stock.



### 5. Consumption Rate

The rate at which products are being consumed or sold is a crucial metric in inventory and business management. It is an invaluable tool for analyzing consumption patterns and market behavior. Understanding this consumption rate allows companies to anticipate replenishment needs, optimize inventory and logistics, and improve sales strategies.

Through this information, companies can predict future demand trends, adjust production or supply accordingly, and ensure that

### 6. Storage Cost

The storage cost KPI is an essential metric in inventory management that involves several critical factors. First, it takes into account all direct and indirect costs associated with inventory storage.

This includes the cost related to the use of the physical space needed to store products, which varies depending on the size and location of the warehouse. It also covers the insurance required to protect stored goods against potential damage or loss. Another important aspect considered in this KPI is the risk of deterioration that products can suffer over time while in storage, which can lead to losses or reductions in their value. Considering these elements allows companies to optimize their storage processes, reduce associated costs, and improve their overall operational efficiency.
