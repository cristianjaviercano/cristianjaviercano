# Perishable Goods

Perishable goods are assets that lose value over time. This category includes not only foods such as fruits, vegetables, and pharmaceuticals, but also goods such as computers and cell phones, which depreciate with the release of new models, or fashionable clothing that loses value at the end of the season. Even production, transportation, and storage capacity can be considered perishable, as unused capacity has no value.

\
Perishable food supply chains, for example, seek to ensure product quality, which decreases as distribution time increases. This often involves "time window" restrictions set by customers to receive products in the best possible condition.

### EOQ and Perishability: Challenges and Considerations<br>

Applying EOQ to perishable products is more complex because obsolescence or spoilage becomes a very significant inventory holding cost. A product with a short life cycle, such as six months, can have an effective obsolescence cost of 200%, which drastically impacts the optimal lot size decision.

\
For perishable products, the inventory model often leans toward a single-period or "newsvendor" model, especially for seasonal or trendy items, where there is a single opportunity to place an order with little or no possibility of reordering or returning stock if demand is forecasted incorrectly. The key decision here is balancing the cost of surpluses (S) and the cost of shortages (S).

* &#x20;_**The cost of surplus (Ca)**_ is the loss per unsold unit at the end of the season, including the original cost of the unit and storage and disposal costs.<br>
* _**The cost of shortages (Cu)**_ is the margin lost per lost sale due to a lack of inventory, including the margin on current and future sales if the customer does not return.

\
The optimal level of product availability (cycle service level, CSL) is achieved by balancing these costs. As the cost of surpluses increases, it is optimal to decrease the target level of product availability. Conversely, as the margin lost due to shortages increases, it is optimal to increase the target level of product availability.
