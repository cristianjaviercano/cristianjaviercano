# Customer service, the Heart of the logistics Management

# Chapter 1: Logistics in Customer Service

## 1.1 Understanding Customer Value and Service

Customer value is fundamentally defined as the perceived benefit a consumer associates with a product or service, relative to its cost. This encompasses all monetary, time, energy, and even emotional costs, balanced against the benefits derived from the offering. The concept can be expressed as a ratio:

**Customer value = (Perception of benefits) / (Total cost of ownership)**

The "total cost of ownership" extends far beyond the initial purchase price, incorporating a range of hidden expenses such as inventory carrying costs, maintenance, operational costs, and disposal costs. This is often visualized as an "iceberg" effect, where the immediate purchase price is only the visible tip, while substantial, often overlooked, costs lie beneath the surface.

In the context of logistics, customer value is shaped by four key elements: **Quality, Service, Cost, and Time**.

- **Quality** pertains to the functionality, performance, and technical specifications of the product or service, ensuring it meets customer requirements.
- **Service** encompasses all support delivered to the customer before, during, and after a purchase, including the flexibility to adapt to evolving customer demands or market changes.
- **Cost** includes all financial transactions incurred by the customer, which are directly influenced by underlying logistics costs (e.g., design, production, distribution, inventory).
- **Time** refers to the duration required to deliver the product to the customer or to respond to their specific needs.

Organizations that successfully deliver greater customer value than their competitors gain a significant competitive advantage. Logistics management is uniquely positioned to influence both the benefits (numerator) and costs (denominator) of the customer value ratio.

Historically, marketing efforts often concentrated on product features, promotional activities, and pricing strategies. However, this traditional approach is no longer sufficient for sustained market success. As markets increasingly commoditize, where perceived product differences diminish, the "order-winning criteria" are shifting from product-based attributes to service-based ones. This implies that while a high-quality product is a prerequisite, its effective delivery—in terms of time, place, and supporting services—becomes the primary differentiator.

The concept of **"service surround"** visually illustrates how logistics activities augment the core product, transforming it from a mere item in a warehouse into a valuable asset once it is in the customer's hands. This fundamental transformation means that competitive differentiation is increasingly derived from superior customer service, elevating logistics to a central strategic function for value creation and market success.

## 1.2 Defining Customer Service Objectives and Elements

Customer service is precisely defined as the consistent provision of time and place utility. This means ensuring that products are in the hands of the customer at the exact time and place required for their value to be realized. It encompasses the professional, efficient, and high-quality assistance and support provided to customers before, during, and after their needs are met. The fundamental role of customer service is to enhance "value-in-use," thereby increasing the perceived worth of the product in the customer's eyes.

The multifaceted nature of customer service is evident in its various components, ranging from on-time delivery to comprehensive after-sales support. It is crucial to recognize that different market segments often attach varying degrees of importance to these diverse service elements. Despite its critical importance in the overall marketing mix, surprisingly few companies have clearly defined policies or organizational structures specifically designed to manage and control customer service effectively.

To optimize service delivery, organizations must first identify distinct customer service segments. Techniques such as cluster analysis can be employed to group customers with similar service priorities. This analytical step helps in differentiating "qualifiers"—the basic service requirements that allow a company to compete in a market—from "order winners"—those service attributes that truly differentiate an offering and secure sales.

Because a "one-size-fits-all" approach to customer service is inefficient and often ineffective, logistics management must develop and implement multiple, tailored supply chain solutions to meet the specific needs of these different value segments.

The key elements and activities of customer service can be broadly categorized by the timing of their provision:

- **Pre-transaction services** involve establishing the necessary framework before a sale, such as defining service policies, structuring the organization for service delivery, and ensuring system flexibility.
- **Transaction elements/services** occur during the sales process, including ensuring stock availability, providing accurate order information, managing order cycle time, ensuring delivery reliability, and offering technical support.
- **Post-transaction services** are provided after the sale is complete, encompassing activities like product installation, warranty and guarantee fulfillment, provision of parts and repairs, handling customer complaints, and product tracing.

The traditional approach of implementing a generic, "one-size-fits-all" customer service policy often proves to be both inefficient and ineffective in today's segmented markets. The ability to identify distinct customer service segments—for example, a "Just-in-Time (JIT) segment" that prioritizes delivery reliability, a "price segment" focused on cost, or a "relationship segment" that values technical support and close supplier liaison—is paramount.

This granular understanding, which distinguishes between basic "qualifiers" and true "order winners," directly informs the design of multiple, highly tailored supply chain solutions. This strategic shift moves beyond simply "providing service" to "strategically delivering differentiated value" that precisely aligns with specific customer needs, thereby maximizing profitability within each segment.

Therefore, effective customer service in logistics is not a generic offering but a strategically segmented approach, demanding a detailed understanding of diverse customer requirements and the design of flexible, differentiated supply chain solutions to meet those specific demands.

## 1.3 The Impact of Out-of-Stock Situations and Customer Retention

Out-of-stock (OOS) situations have far-reaching negative consequences for businesses, extending beyond immediate lost sales. If a product is unavailable and a close substitute exists, the sale is typically lost to a competitor. Even for brands with strong customer loyalty, a stock-out can be sufficient to trigger brand switching.

The financial impact of OOS is significant, incurring substantial cost penalties for both manufacturers and retailers. Direct costs include immediate lost sales revenue, reduced profit margins, and increased supply chain and shipping costs associated with rush orders to replenish stock. Indirect costs, which are often less visible but equally damaging, include the costs of carrying excess inventory elsewhere in the supply chain, additional storage expenses, and the costs of expediting replenishment.

Beyond direct financial losses, OOS leads to considerable customer dissatisfaction and frustration, which can result in a decline in loyalty and a higher likelihood of customers switching to competitors. It can severely damage a brand's reputation and erode customer trust, as consumers may associate OOS with inadequate planning, poor supply chain management, or a lack of commitment to meeting customer needs. Consistency in product availability is crucial for building credibility and trust. Furthermore, loyal customers who experience stock-outs may transform from brand advocates into sources of negative word-of-mouth, impacting potential referrals. Internally, dealing with dissatisfied customers due to OOS can also negatively affect employee morale, particularly for customer-facing roles.

Given these repercussions, customer retention emerges as a critical strategic imperative. It is consistently less expensive to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. Research indicates that even a modest increase in customer retention rates, such as 5%, can boost profits by 25% to 95%. Organizations that augment their basic products with added-value services gain a significant competitive advantage. The "service surround" concept effectively illustrates how logistics activities contribute to this value augmentation, transforming a product's utility and perceived worth.

Logistics efficiency plays a direct and indirect role in fostering customer experience, loyalty, and retention, ensuring the continuity of sales and business operations. Key strategies for enhancing customer retention through logistics include delivering consistent service quality, proactively resolving problems, and engaging customers strategically. Leveraging technology, such as real-time tracking and automated customer service platforms, is also vital for building trust and confidence by keeping customers informed about order and delivery statuses.

The immediate impact of an out-of-stock event, such as a lost sale, is readily apparent. However, a deeper analysis reveals a cascading effect of indirect and long-term costs that are often overlooked. These include the erosion of brand equity, a decline in customer trust, increased customer churn, the spread of negative word-of-mouth, and even detrimental effects on internal employee morale.

This demonstrates that short-term cost-cutting measures that compromise inventory levels or delivery reliability can lead to far greater financial and reputational damage in the long run. Conversely, proactive logistics management, characterized by real-time visibility, accurate forecasting, and responsive problem-solving, is not merely about fulfilling orders. It is fundamentally about building and sustaining customer trust and loyalty, which are direct drivers of long-term profitability and competitive advantage. Therefore, investing in logistics capabilities that ensure product availability and superior service is a critical customer retention strategy, transforming logistics from a reactive function to a proactive driver of sustained profitability.

## 1.4 Market-Driven Supply Chains and Omni-Channel Retailing

Market-driven supply chains are fundamentally customer-centric, designed "customer backwards" to understand and meet evolving customer requirements as a prerequisite for organizational survival. These agile supply chains leverage robust analytics for value segmentation and simulation analyses to tailor their offerings. This represents a significant shift from traditional "production push" models, which optimized operations through level scheduling and long planning horizons, to "demand pull" systems, where products are made, sourced, or moved only when actual demand dictates.

The manner in which products reach customers—the distribution channel—has become a critical competitive dimension. The rise of omni-channel retailing represents a revolutionary change in this landscape, driven by the astronomic growth of online shopping and evolving consumer habits.

A key distinction exists between multi-channel and omni-channel retailing. Multi-channel retailing typically involves separate and often independent logistics and distribution arrangements for each sales channel (e.g., brick-and-mortar stores, catalog sales, online platforms). In contrast, omni-channel retailing aims to integrate these disparate channels, creating a seamless and consistent customer experience across all touchpoints, underpinned by a single, hybrid supply chain.

The implications of this shift for logistics are profound. It necessitates the development of new logistics infrastructure capable of handling and delivering smaller units more frequently, directly to end-users. A significant challenge in this model is managing the "last mile" costs associated with home deliveries, which can be substantial for individual packages. Despite these challenges, the benefits of an omni-channel approach are considerable, including efficient service for rapidly growing online businesses, reductions in physical stockroom space (freeing up retail selling space), and impressive improvements in overall operating costs and stock-turns.

The emergence of omni-channel retailing is not merely a technological advancement; it represents a fundamental reordering of power dynamics within the supply chain. By placing the customer at the center, it effectively "democratizes" the supply chain. This means that the diverse and evolving shopping habits of consumers—such as preferences for smaller, more frequent purchases, or the adoption of "click and collect" options—directly dictate the required supply chain architecture.

The success of pioneering omni-channel models, like that of John Lewis, hinges on transforming logistics from a bulk-delivery model to one capable of handling single units, requiring substantial investment in flexible infrastructure and dynamic routing capabilities. This implies that supply chain design is no longer an internal, cost-driven exercise but an external, customer-driven imperative.

Therefore, the rise of omni-channel retailing underscores the necessity for supply chains to be truly market-driven, adapting their design and operations to diverse and dynamic customer preferences, moving beyond channel-specific logistics to integrated, flexible systems that prioritize seamless customer experience and value delivery.

# Measuring and Calculating Customer Service in a Logistics Management System

Customer service is a core component of logistics management, directly impacting customer satisfaction, retention, and overall competitive advantage. To manage and improve customer service, organizations must be able to **measure** and **calculate** its effectiveness using a variety of tools and metrics. This guide outlines key tools, metrics, and methodologies for assessing customer service in logistics.

---

## 1. Tools for Measuring Customer Service in Logistics

### a. KPIs and Performance Dashboards

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)** are specific metrics used to monitor service levels.
- Common logistics KPIs related to customer service include:
  - **Order Cycle Time:** Time from order placement to delivery.
  - **On-Time Delivery Rate:** Percentage of orders delivered on or before the promised date.
  - **Order Fill Rate:** Percentage of customer orders fulfilled completely from stock.
  - **Perfect Order Rate:** Percentage of orders delivered without errors, damages, or delays.
  - **Customer Complaint Rate:** Number of complaints per period or per 1000 orders.

- **Dashboards** aggregate KPI data for quick visualization and decision-making.

### b. Surveys and Customer Feedback

- **Customer Satisfaction Surveys:** Structured questionnaires to measure perceived service quality.
- **Net Promoter Score (NPS):** Measures customer willingness to recommend the company to others.
- **Post-Delivery Feedback:** Ratings and reviews collected after delivery.

### c. Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

- **SLAs** are formal agreements defining service quality standards.
- SLAs specify targets for delivery time, accuracy, responsiveness, and more.
- Performance against SLA targets is tracked and reported.

### d. Automated Tracking Systems

- Use of **Warehouse Management Systems (WMS)** and **Transportation Management Systems (TMS)** to record and analyze:
  - Shipment status
  - Delivery times
  - Inventory availability
  - Exception handling (delays, damages)

---

## 2. Methods for Calculating Customer Service Metrics

### a. Order Fill Rate

```math
Order Fill Rate = \frac{\text{Number of Orders Completely Fulfilled}}{\text{Total Number of Orders}} \times 100\%
```

### b. On-Time Delivery Rate

```math
On-Time Delivery Rate = \frac{\text{Number of Orders Delivered On Time}}{\text{Total Number of Orders Delivered}} \times 100\%
```

### c. Perfect Order Rate

A perfect order is one that is delivered:
- On time
- Complete
- Undamaged
- With correct documentation

```math
Perfect Order Rate = \frac{\text{Number of Perfect Orders}}{\text{Total Orders}} \times 100\%
```

### d. Order Cycle Time

```math
Order Cycle Time = \text{Delivery Date} - \text{Order Placement Date}
```
- Can be averaged over all orders in a time period.

### e. Customer Complaint Rate

```math
Customer Complaint Rate = \frac{\text{Number of Complaints}}{\text{Total Orders}} \times 1000
```
- Indicates issues per thousand orders.

---

## 3. Advanced Measurement Approaches

### a. Service Reliability Index

- Combines metrics like order accuracy, delivery punctuality, and damage rates into a single score.

### b. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

- Estimates total profit from a customer based on retention and repeat business, influenced by service quality.

### c. Segmentation Analysis

- Measuring service levels for different customer or market segments (e.g., JIT segment, price-sensitive segment).

---

## 4. Continuous Improvement Tools

### a. Root Cause Analysis

- Investigates reasons for poor service (e.g., delays, errors) to implement corrective action.

### b. Benchmarking

- Compares service metrics against industry standards or best-in-class competitors.

### c. Lean and Six Sigma

- Process improvement methodologies to reduce waste, errors, and delays in logistics operations, thereby enhancing customer service.

## 5. Example: Measuring Customer Service in Practice

Suppose a company delivered 950 out of 1000 orders on time, 970 orders were completely filled, and 920 orders were perfect (on time, complete, undamaged, correct documentation). There were 8 customer complaints.

- **Order Fill Rate:** (970 / 1000) × 100% = 97%
- **On-Time Delivery Rate:** (950 / 1000) × 100% = 95%
- **Perfect Order Rate:** (920 / 1000) × 100% = 92%
- **Customer Complaint Rate:** (8 / 1000) × 1000 = 8 complaints per 1000 orders

# Key Logistics Performance Metrics: OTIF & OEEE

In logistics and supply chain management, precise measurement of performance is essential for continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. Two widely used metrics are **OTIF (On Time In Full)** and **OEEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness and Efficiency)**. Below is an explanation of each, including calculation methods and their importance.

---

## 1. OTIF (On Time In Full)

### What is OTIF?

**OTIF** stands for **On Time In Full** and measures the percentage of customer orders delivered both on time and in complete quantity as requested. OTIF is a critical indicator of supply chain reliability and customer service quality.

### Why is OTIF Important?

- High OTIF rates mean customers receive their orders as promised, improving satisfaction and trust.
- Low OTIF can result in customer complaints, lost sales, and damage to brand reputation.
- OTIF helps identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in logistics, inventory, and order processing.

### How to Calculate OTIF

```math
OTIF (\%) = \frac{\text{Number of Orders Delivered On Time and In Full}}{\text{Total Number of Orders Delivered}} \times 100
```

- **On Time**: Delivered at or before the agreed date.
- **In Full**: Delivered with the exact quantity and specifications ordered.

### Example

If you delivered 950 out of 1000 orders both on time and in full:

```math
OTIF = \frac{950}{1000} \times 100 = 95\%
```

---

## 2. OEEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness and Efficiency)

### What is OEEE?

**OEEE** stands for **Overall Equipment Effectiveness and Efficiency** (sometimes simply called OEE). It measures how well manufacturing or logistics equipment is utilized compared to its full potential. OEEE combines three factors: **Availability**, **Performance**, and **Quality**.

### Components of OEEE

1. **Availability**
   - Ratio of actual operating time to scheduled operating time.
2. **Performance**
   - Ratio of actual output to the theoretical maximum output.
3. **Quality**
   - Ratio of good units produced to total units produced.

### OEEE Formula

```math
OEEE (\%) = Availability \times Performance \times Quality \times 100
```

Where:

- **Availability (\%)** = (Operating Time / Planned Production Time)
- **Performance (\%)** = (Ideal Cycle Time × Total Units Produced) / Operating Time
- **Quality (\%)** = (Good Units / Total Units Produced)

### Example

Suppose for a shift:

- Planned Production Time = 8 hours (480 min)
- Downtime = 30 min → Operating Time = 450 min
- Ideal cycle time = 1 min/unit
- Total Units Produced = 400
- Good Units = 390

Calculations:

- **Availability** = 450 / 480 = 0.9375 (93.75%)
- **Performance** = (1 × 400) / 450 = 0.8889 (88.89%)
- **Quality** = 390 / 400 = 0.975 (97.5%)
- **OEEE** = 0.9375 × 0.8889 × 0.975 × 100 = 81.1%

---

## 3. Practical Use

- **OTIF** is used by logistics managers to monitor service reliability and keep customers satisfied.
- **OEEE** is used by operations and maintenance teams to maximize equipment productivity and identify improvement areas.
