# DIstribution Center (Cedis)

A Distribution Center, commonly known as CEDIS, is a key infrastructure within logistics and supply chain management. These facilities are designed to streamline the movement and storage of goods, ensuring efficient distribution to the final customer.

The importance of a CEDIS in the supply chain centers on several fundamental aspects:

1. **Centralization of Operations**: It allows products from various suppliers to be consolidated in one place, making inventory control and tracking easier.

CEDIS are a vital component to ensure the timely availability of products in the market, optimizing the flow of goods from manufacturers to consumers and contributing to market competitiveness.

2. **Inventory Optimization**: A well-managed CEDIS helps reduce storage costs by minimizing excess inventory.

Types of companies that operate as CEDIS:

* **Retailers**: Retail stores that store products before distributing them to their different branches.
* **Wholesalers**: Companies that sell products in bulk to retailers or other distributors.
* **E-commerce companies**: Online platforms that require fast storage and processing for direct shipments to customers.
* **Manufacturers**: Companies that manage distribution centers to supply their clients or branches.

Distribution Centers (CEDIS) play a crucial role in supply chain management by ensuring that products are available in the market in a timely and efficient manner.

### Interaction of a CEDI with Location, Transport, and Inventory Models

{% hint style="info" %}
The interaction of a Distribution and Logistics Center (CEDI) with location, transport, and inventory models is crucial to optimize operational efficiency within the supply chain.

**Location Models**

The proper location of a CEDI directly influences its operational effectiveness. Site selection should consider factors such as proximity to demand, accessibility to infrastructure, and transportation costs.

**Transport Models**

A CEDI must also interact with efficient transport models to coordinate the distribution of goods. These models include planning optimal routes, selecting means of transport, and managing delivery schedules.

**Inventory Models**

Inventory management is another critical aspect where the CEDI has significant influence. Inventory models in a logistics center must be highly adaptable to respond to the variable demands of the market.

Altogether, the interaction of a CEDI with these models not only improves the efficiency of its internal operations but also creates value throughout the entire supply chain. This leads to greater competitiveness and customer satisfaction.

**Python Interaction with CEDIS Models**

Python is a powerful tool that can be used to optimize and automate various aspects of CEDI management. Its application in this context can focus on data analysis, process optimization, and the implementation of predictive models.

1. **Data Analysis**: Python offers libraries like Pandas and NumPy for processing and analyzing large volumes of data from CEDI operations. Additionally, visualization tools like Matplotlib help present results clearly.

**Achievement of Main KPIs**

Python facilitates the improvement of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the CEDI, such as:

* **Delivery Time**: Optimizing dispatch routes using Python algorithms reduces delivery time and improves on-time performance.
* **Inventory Accuracy**: Implementing predictive models with Python can improve accuracy in inventory management, reducing excess and shortages.
* **Operating Costs**: Automating administrative and maintenance processes with Python helps reduce operating costs by minimizing human intervention and error.

By using Python, CEDIS can move towards more efficient, data-driven operations adapted to changing market demands.

### Practical Exercise: Mathematical Modeling in Python

This exercise is designed to apply mathematical modeling to achieve CEDI KPIs using Python. Below are the steps to implement a basic optimization model:

#### Step 1: Problem Description

Suppose we have a CEDI that wants to optimize its dispatch process to reduce delivery time. Our goal will be to develop a model that allows us to calculate the most efficient routes.

#### Step 2: Importing Libraries

We will start by importing the necessary libraries for our analysis:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from scipy.optimize import linprog
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

### Step 3: Model Formulation

We will formulate a linear optimization problem where we define key variables such as truck capacity, customer demand, and travel times.

### Step 4: Algorithm Implementation

We will develop the code to optimize the dispatch routes. We will use the scipy.optimize.linprog optimization function to minimize the total delivery time.

```python
# Basic optimization example
c = [...] # Costs associated with routes
A_eq = [...] # Equality constraint matrix
b_eq = [...] # Demand vector
result = linprog(c, A_eq=A_eq, b_eq=b_eq, method='simplex')
```

#### Step 5: Results Analysis

Once we have the solution, we can analyze the results to identify possible improvements in the process. We will graph delivery times before and after optimization.

#### Step 6: Model Validation

Compare the optimized results with historical data to validate the effectiveness of the model. Adjust parameters if necessary to improve prediction accuracy.
