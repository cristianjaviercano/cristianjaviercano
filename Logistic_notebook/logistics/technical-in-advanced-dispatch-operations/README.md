# Technical in Advanced Dispatch Operations

## Pedagogical Framework

The course follows a logical progression mirroring the physical and informational flow of a standard dispatch operation: from order inception to final analysis and reporting. Each competency is structured to first establish a theoretical foundation, often including a conceptual or mathematical model, followed by practical application.

### Theoretical Models:&#x20;

Concepts such as queuing theory for order processing or optimization algorithms for vehicle routing will be introduced conceptually before showing their application.

#### Practical Tools:

* **AnyLogic:** Simulation models will be used as a visual aid to demonstrate complex dynamic processes, such as warehouse workflow or vehicle fleet management. This serves to illustrate concepts, not to teach simulation modeling itself.
* **Java:** Simple code snippets and applications will be developed to demonstrate the back-end logic of dispatch systems, such as data validation, sorting algorithms, or API interactions. This provides insight into the information systems that underpin logistics.
* **Google Suite:** The entire course workflow is integrated with Google tools. Google Slides will be used for presentations, Google Forms for assessments, and Google Docs/Sheets for assignments, centralizing all learning materials.
* **GitBooks:** The platform will host all content, including text, images, links to Google Suite assets, and code snippets, creating a structured and accessible online textbook.
