# Project Implementation Guide: Engineering & Innovation (UPB - Minciencias)

## Project Implementation Guide: Engineering & Innovation (UPB - Minciencias)

This guide provides the formal structure for academic and research projects within the Industrial Engineering program at **Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana, Montería**\[cite: 1906, 2241]. \[cite\_start]It integrates the scientific method with the technical requirements of **Minciencias** and **APA 7th Edition** formatting\[cite: 1910, 2031, 2301].

***

### Front Matter

* **Title**: 15–17 words maximum, concise, without abbreviations\[cite: 1937, 1938, 1939].
* **Authors**: Full names and institutional affiliation\[cite: 121, 1980, 1981].
* **Abstract**: Maximum 250 words summarizing problem, objectives, methodology, and expected results.

***

### Chapter 1: The Problem

This chapter defines the research gap or technical opportunity

* **1.1 Project Classification**: Define if the project is **Basic/Applied Research**, **Experimental Development**, or **Innovation** (Product/Process) according to Minciencias
* **1.2 Problem Statement**: Describe the situation from a global to a local (Montería/Córdoba) perspective.
* **1.3 Research Question/Hypothesis**: Formulate the central scientific or technological uncertainty to be resolved
* **1.4 Justification**: Detail the relevance and impact based on International (SDGs), National, and Local development plans.
* **1.5 Objectives (SMART Approach)**:
  * **General Objective**: The primary achievement (What and For what?).
  * **Specific Objectives**: Maximum 5 steps, including bibliometric analysis and technical tool identification.

***

### Chapter 2: Theoretical Framework

Theoretical foundation and the "State of the Art"

* **2.1 Background & State of the Art**: Review of previous national and international studies
* **2.2 Bibliometric Analysis**: Descriptive statistics of literature (Authors, years, keywords) using tools like **VOSviewer** for information clustering
* **2.3 Technological Surveillance**: Analysis of scientific databases and patents to verify the novelty of the proposal
* **2.4 Theoretical Bases**: Theoretical support for the engineering tools to be used (e.g., Linear Programming, Discrete Optimization, Method Engineering)

***

### Chapter 3: Methodological Framework (Marco Metodológico)

The systematic path to achieving the objectives

* **3.1 Research Design**: Identification of the research level and type (Experimental, Descriptive, or Mixed)
* **3.2 Population and Sample**: Identification of the observed system and sampling techniques
* **3.3 Data Collection Techniques**: Description of instruments such as surveys, direct observation, or laboratory experiments
* **3.4 Technical Solution Design**: Application of engineering tools like flowcharts, time studies, or simulation models
* **3.5 Risk Management**: Identification of risks and mitigation strategies based on **PMI** or Logical Framework

***

### Chapter 4: Research Development&#x20;

Implementation of the engineering solution and results analysis

* **4.1 Implementation of Engineering Tools**: Modeling, optimization, and development of prototypes or pilot plans
* **4.2 Results & Discussion**: Presentation of data using **APA-formatted tables and figures**, contrasting findings with existing theory
* **4.3 Financial Analysis**: Evaluation of project feasibility (e.g., NPV, IRR) and market potential
* **4.4 Project Control**: Execution of the work plan using **Gantt charts** and **WBS (EDT)** for time and resource control

***

### Chapter 5: Bibliography&#x20;

* **Format**: All cited sources must appear here following **APA 7th Edition**
* **Indentation**: Hanging indent of 1.27 cm (0.5 in)
* **Order**: Alphabetical by author's last name

***

### Chapter 6: Appendices (Anexos)

* Additional relevant information: maps, technical drawings, detailed budgets for prototyping, and ethical/environmental permits
