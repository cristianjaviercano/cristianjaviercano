1. Open the website: [Drawio](https://app.diagrams.net/).com
2. Choose to work offline or connect to your Google Drive, Dropbox, or other storage services to save your diagrams.
3. Select a template or start with a blank canvas.
4. Use the drag-and-drop interface to add shapes, connectors, and labels.
5. Save or export your diagram in various formats like PNG, PDF, or SVG.

In order ti create the user interface and all the flow of the Integral solution, need to use some diferents diagramas to explain.

1. **User Flow Diagram with Embedded Wireframes:** This is the main diagram. It maps the user's journey through the application. Each step in the flow would not just be a box with text but a simplified wireframe of the screen.&#x20;
2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** This is the standard for modeling the database structure. Simplified Component Diagram: This diagram shows the logical modules of the backend.
3. **Component Diagram (Simplified):** This diagram illustrates the backend's logical modules.

## User Flow Diagram With Embedded Wireframes

A user flow diagram with embedded wireframes is a visual representation that combines both the journey a user takes through an application and sketches or simplified versions of the screens they will encounter. This type of diagram is particularly beneficial for understanding the user experience design and ensuring every screen's purpose is clear.

### Steps to Create a User Flow Diagram with Embedded Wireframes:

1. **Identify User Tasks:** Determine the primary tasks users need to accomplish within your application.
2. **Define Entry and Exit Points:** Specify where users will start their journey and the potential endpoints based on different paths they may take.
3. **Map Out Key Screens:** Create simplified wireframes for each significant screen or interaction point in the user journey.
4. **Add Annotations:** Include notes or labels on your wireframes to clarify the functionality or purpose of each element.
5. **Link Screens in Sequence:** Use arrows or lines to connect related screens, clearly indicating the flow between them.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive user flow diagram that provides clarity and direction for both designers and developers working on the project.
