In order ti create the user interface and all the flow of the Integral solution, need to use some diferents diagramas to explain.

1. **User Flow Diagram with Embedded Wireframes:** This is the main diagram. It maps the user's journey through the application. Each step in the flow would not just be a box with text but a simplified wireframe of the screen.&#x20;
2. **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD):** This is the standard for modeling the database structure. Simplified Component Diagram: This diagram shows the logical modules of the backend.
3. **Component Diagram (Simplified):** This diagram illustrates the backend's logical modules.

## User Flow Diagram With Embedded Wireframes

A user flow diagram with embedded wireframes is a visual representation that combines both the journey a user takes through an application and sketches or simplified versions of the screens they will encounter. This type of diagram is particularly beneficial for understanding the user experience design and ensuring every screen's purpose is clear.

### Steps to Create a User Flow Diagram with Embedded Wireframes:

1. **Identify User Tasks:** Determine the primary tasks users need to accomplish within your application.
2. **Define Entry and Exit Points:** Specify where users will start their journey and the potential endpoints based on different paths they may take.
3. **Map Out Key Screens:** Create simplified wireframes for each significant screen or interaction point in the user journey.
4. **Add Annotations:** Include notes or labels on your wireframes to clarify the functionality or purpose of each element.
5. **Link Screens in Sequence:** Use arrows or lines to connect related screens, clearly indicating the flow between them.

By following these steps, you can create a comprehensive user flow diagram that provides clarity and direction for both designers and developers working on the project.

> lets make an example of a inventory store aplication.

To create a solution, first define the main goal of the application to develop the solution app. In this case, we will create an inventory management tool for a retail store that can handle different types of items like food, groceries, beverages, and their expiration dates.

Similar to any inventory system, it includes three main processes and specific KPIs. The primary processes are:

1.  #### Inbound Process

    The inbound process involves the systematic receipt and management of goods and materials arriving at a facility. Key steps include:

    1. **Receiving**: Accept incoming shipments and verify them against purchase orders.
    2. **Inspection**: Check goods for quality and accuracy.
    3. **Unpacking**: Open containers and prepare items for storage.
    4. **Inventory Management**: Update inventory records and organize items in designated storage locations.
    5. **Quality Control**: Conduct thorough checks to ensure products meet standards.
    6. **Documentation**: Maintain accurate records of all inbound activities for auditing and tracking.

    Effective inbound processing ensures smooth operations, accurate inventory levels, and enhanced supply chain efficiency.
2.  **Outbound Process**

    The Outbound Process is a crucial logistics function involving the preparation and transfer of products from a company to its customers or distribution centers. This ensures that products are delivered accurately and on time. The process involves several key steps that must be executed efficiently:

    1. **Order Management**: The process begins with the receipt of customer orders through various channels such as online platforms, emails, or direct sales. This involves managing the order database and prioritizing orders based on various factors like delivery location and urgency.
    2. **Inventory Management**: Inventory levels are checked to ensure the ordered items are in stock. This involves real-time inventory tracking and making adjustments as necessary to minimize delays and meet customer demands.
    3. **Order Picking**: The picking process involves retrieving products from their storage locations based on the order list. Efficient picking strategies like batch picking or zone picking are often employed to optimize time and resources.
    4. **Quality Check**: Before packaging, the products undergo a quality check to confirm that they meet the required standards. Any defective or incorrect items are removed and replaced.
    5. **Packaging**: Products are then securely packaged using appropriate materials to prevent damage during transit. The packaging should also be labeled with necessary information such as addresses, special handling instructions, and barcodes for tracking.
    6. **Labeling**: Correct labeling is essential for ensuring that the products are directed to the right destinations. This includes printing and affixing shipping labels generated via automated systems.
    7. **Shipping**: Once packaged and labeled, the products are prepared for shipment. This involves selecting the most efficient and cost-effective transportation methods based on the destination and delivery schedule.
    8. **Tracking and Documentation**: Tracking systems are utilized to monitor the shipment's progress and communicate its status to customers and stakeholders. Accurate documentation ensures compliance with any regulatory requirements and facilitates smooth customs processing for international shipments.
    9. **Customer Communication**: Keeping customers informed about their order status and delivery timelines is vital. Automated notifications and customer service support play a role in managing expectations and addressing inquiries effectively.
    10. **Review and Feedback**: Continuous review of the outbound process is crucial for identifying areas of improvement. Feedback from customers and performance metrics assist in optimizing procedures and enhancing customer satisfaction.

    Overall, a well-organized and efficient outbound process helps companies maintain high service standards, reduce errors, and achieve customer satisfaction and loyalty.
3.  #### Inventory Management Process

    Effective inventory management is crucial for maintaining optimal stock levels, reducing costs, and ensuring customer satisfaction. The process involves several key steps as outlined below:

    1. **Demand Forecasting**:
       * Use historical sales data and market analysis to predict future inventory requirements.
       * Implement forecasting tools and techniques to increase accuracy.
    2. **Stock Replenishment**:
       * Establish reorder points and stock levels to prevent overstocking or stockouts.
       * Automate the ordering process to streamline replenishment.
    3. **Inventory Tracking**:
       * Utilize inventory management software to monitor stock levels in real-time.
       * Implement barcode or RFID systems for accurate item tracking.
    4. **Storage and Handling**:
       * Organize the warehouse to optimize space and streamline picking processes.
       * Maintain proper storage conditions to preserve product quality.
    5. **Inventory Analysis**:
       * Conduct regular inventory audits and cycle counts to verify stock levels.
       * Analyze turnover rates and adjust inventory practices as needed.
    6. **Supplier and Vendor Management**:
       * Build strong relationships with suppliers to ensure timely delivery of quality products.
       * Negotiate favorable terms and agreements to improve supply chain efficiency.
    7. **Customer Order Fulfillment**:
       * Ensure quick and accurate processing of customer orders.
       * Implement efficient packaging and shipping practices to enhance customer satisfaction.

    By following these steps, businesses can achieve better inventory control, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency within their supply chain.

#### First step: creates a general flow of the aplication using a whiteboard or a paper.
