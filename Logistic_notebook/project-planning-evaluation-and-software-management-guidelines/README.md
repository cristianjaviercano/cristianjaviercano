# Project Planning, Evaluation, and Software Management Guidelines

## Welcome to Project Formulation & Evaluation

### 👋 Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation and learning hub for the **Formulation and Evaluation of Projects** module. This course is designed to provide you with the theoretical and instrumental elements necessary to identify, formulate, evaluate, and manage investment projects within the engineering sector.

Unlike traditional management courses, this module integrates **scientific rigor** with **modern technical tools**. We will bridge the gap between standard project evaluation methodologies (PMI, UNIDO) and data-driven decision-making using **Python**.

### 🎯 Course Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Identify Opportunities:** Analyze market failures and business opportunities to generate viable investment alternatives\[cite: 29].
2. **Structure Projects:** Develop comprehensive Market, Technical, Administrative, Legal, and Financial studies\[cite: 31].
3. **Evaluate Viability:** Determine financial feasibility using rigorous indicators such as NPV (Net Present Value) and IRR (Internal Rate of Return)\[cite: 30].
4. **Manage Strategy:** Understand the project lifecycle and apply strategic management principles during execution\[cite: 28].

### 🛠️ Tools & Methodology

This course uses a **"Learning by Doing"** approach. While we cover the theoretical frameworks required by the syllabus, we will also leverage technology to modernize the formulation process.

* **Theory:** Based on standard methodologies (Sapag Chain, PMI, MGA).
* **Documentation:** All lecture notes, slides, and guides are hosted here on **GitBook**.
* **Computation:** We will use **Python (Jupyter Notebooks)** for:
  * Market forecasting (Time series analysis).
  * Financial sensitivity analysis.
  * Decision matrixes for technical location.

#### Prerequisites

* Basic understanding of engineering economics.
* A Google account (to access Colab/Drive).
* Desire to innovate in process engineering.

***

### 📚 Assessment System

The evaluation follows the program's regulations:

* **20%** - Specific Topic Presentation.
* **40%** - Group Work (Progressive Project Formulation).
* **40%** - Final Evaluation (Comprehensive Project Defense).
