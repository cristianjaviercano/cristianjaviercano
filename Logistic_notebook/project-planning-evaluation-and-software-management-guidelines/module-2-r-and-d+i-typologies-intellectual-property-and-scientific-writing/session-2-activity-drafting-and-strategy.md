# Session 2 Activity: Drafting & Strategy

1. **Typology Check:** Classify your project (Research, Development, or Innovation) and justify it using the _Minciencias_ criteria (Novelty + Uncertainty).
2.  **IP Search:** Go to [Google Patents](https://patents.google.com/) or [https://lens.org](https://lens.org)

    . Find 2 patents related to your idea.

    * _Deliverable:_ Cite the patents and explain **one difference** that makes your idea novel (e.g., "Patent X uses Method A, we propose Method B which reduces energy by 10%").
3. **Drafting Exercise:** Write the **General Objective** of your project in two formats:
   * _As a Research Project:_ "To determine the effect of X on Y..."
   * _As an Innovation Project:_ "To develop and validate a prototype of..."

**Deliverable:** Save these outputs in your notebook \[jupyter notebook].
