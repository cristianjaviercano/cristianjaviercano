# Module 1: Fundamentals & Project Identification

## Methodological Approaches to Problem Definition

In the realm of project formulation, the initial definition of the problem is the cornerstone of success. Different methodologies offer distinct nuances on what constitutes a "problem" and how it should be treated. Below, we explore the three primary perspectives used in engineering and management.

### Methodological Perspectives

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="PMI" %}


For the PMI, problem identification is intrinsically linked to Scope Management and Quality Management, as well as the development of the Business Case.

* Definition: A problem is defined as the deviation between a real situation and a desired situation. It is an obstacle or difficulty that invites resolution to achieve a goal.
* The Business Case: Projects typically initiate with a _Business Case_, which documents the business need and the existing gap (the problem) to justify the investment.
* Requirements Management: A common cause of failure is poor requirements definition at the onset. The PMI suggests that approximately 47% of failed projects are due to poor requirements management regarding the original problem.
* Root Cause Analysis: The focus is not merely on treating symptoms but on investigating the true origin of the problem to eliminate it permanently.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="The Logical Framework Approach (LFA / MML)" %}
The Logical Framework is a conceptualization and design tool that centers the entire project around solving a central problem.

* Image of Reality: Problem analysis is used to create a comprehensive vision of the existing negative situation.
* Syntax of the Problem: A "golden rule" in LFA is that a problem is not the absence of a solution, but an existing negative state.
  * _Incorrect:_ "Lack of a hospital" (absence of solution).
  * _Correct:_ "High morbidity rates" (real problem).
* Consensus: It relies heavily on stakeholder analysis to ensure the identified problem is relevant to the beneficiaries
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="The MGA Perspective (General Adjusted Methodology)" %}
The MGA (Metodología General Ajustada), primarily used for public investment in Colombia, adopts Logical Framework principles but standardizes them into a sequential flow.

* Identification Module: This is the mandatory first step. One must identify a negative situation affecting a specific population group within a determined geographic space.
* Strict Causality: The MGA requires validating vertical logic: _"If causes exist, the problem presents itself; if the problem exists, effects are generated"_.
* Link to Solution: The direct causes identified in the MGA are mandatorily transformed into the project's specific objectives.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Tools for Problem Identification and Analysis

To diagnose problems effectively, we utilize a mix of qualitative and quantitative tools.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Cause-Effect Diagram (Ishikawa or Fishbone)" %}
A fundamental visual tool referenced in both PMI and Quality contexts.

* Function: It serves to identify, explore, and visualize all possible causes related to a specific problem to discover its root cause.
* Structure: The problem is placed at the "head" of the fish, and causes are distributed along the major spines, often categorized by the 6Ms: Materials, Methods, Manpower, Machinery, Measurement, and Mother Nature (Environment).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Pareto Analysis (80/20 Rule)" %}
* unction: Helps prioritize problems or causes based on the premise that 80% of problems stem from 20% of causes.
* Usage: It allows the project manager to focus efforts on the "vital few" rather than the "trivial many"
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Brainstorming" %}
A group technique to generate a broad list of potential problems or causes before filtering and structuring them. It is essential in the identification phase of MGA and LFA to involve experts and the community
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="SWOT Analysis (FODA)" %}
Analyzes Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats. It helps position the project by understanding internal capabilities and the external environment.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="The 5 Whys (Root Cause Analysis)" %}
Consists of asking "Why?" repeatedly (usually 5 times) until reaching the fundamental cause of a problem, avoiding superficial symptoms.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

## Construction of Problem and Objective Trees

This is the core technique in LFA and MGA for structuring project logic.

#### Step 1: The Problem Tree (The Diagnosis)

This tool organizes causes and effects into a visual hierarchy.

1. The Trunk (Central Problem): A single central problem is defined. If multiple exist, they must be prioritized or separated into different trees.
2. The Roots (Causes): Located below the problem. Divided into direct causes (immediately generating the problem) and indirect causes (generating the direct causes).
3. The Crown (Effects): Located above the problem. These are the consequences if the problem remains unresolved, divided into direct and indirect effects.

> Validation: Logic must be verified: Roots provoke the trunk, and the trunk provokes the branches.

#### Step 2: The Objectives Tree (The Proposal)

Once the Problem Tree is validated, it is transformed into positive situations to create the Objectives Tree.

| Element in Problem Tree (Negative) | Transformation to Objectives Tree (Positive) | Function in Project (MGA/LFA)                                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Central Problem                    | General Objective / Purpose                  | The central hypothesis of the project; what is expected to be achieved upon completion.   |
| Causes (Roots)                     | Means / Specific Objectives                  | Direct causes become the means or components the project must deliver.                    |
| Effects (Crown)                    | Ends                                         | Represent the long-term impact or the project's contribution to higher development goals. |

#### Step 3: Analysis of Alternatives

Distinct options for executing the project emerge from the Objectives Tree (specifically from the "means" at the bottom). Concrete actions must be identified to operationalize these means. These actions are then filtered to configure the optimal alternative that is technically, legally, and financially viable, using statistic measurements.

## Introduction to the Investment Project Lifecycle

Economic efficiency demands the generation of maximum profitability in productive investments across all economic sectors. To achieve this, a project must not be viewed as an isolated event, but as a continuous process—a **lifecycle**—that spans from the initial conception of an idea to the final termination of the operation.

The lifecycle of an investment project consists of four distinct stages, designed to progressively reduce uncertainty regarding the viability and profitability of the investment.

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw.svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

#### 1.1 Pre-Investment Stage

<img src="../../.gitbook/assets/file.excalidraw (23).svg" alt="" class="gitbook-drawing">

This is the planning phase where the primary objective is to evaluate the convenience of the investment before committing significant resources. \[cite\_start]It is subdivided into levels of increasing depth and precision:

1. **Idea:** The preliminary identification of an unsatisfied need, a market failure, or a potential business opportunity.
2. **Profile:** A basic analysis using secondary information and global estimates to determine if the idea warrants further study.
3. **Pre-Feasibility:** A detailed evaluation of viable alternatives using more specific data.
4. **Feasibility:** The final analysis based on primary information (direct market research, engineering designs), which provides the basis for the "Go/No-Go" decision.

#### 1.2 Investment Stage

Once the project is deemed viable, this stage involves the execution of the physical and financial implementation. It includes final engineering designs, infrastructure construction, equipment procurement, and installation.

#### 1.3 Operation Stage

This is the productive phase where the project generates the designed goods or services. \[cite\_start]During this stage, the projected cash flows (operational revenues and expenditures) are realized.

#### 1.4 Termination Stage

\[cite\_start]The conclusion of the project's useful life, involving the liquidation of assets or the final closure of the operation.

### 2. Problem Identification & Diagnosis

A successful project formulation depends entirely on a correct identification of the problem. \[cite\_start]If the problem is poorly defined, the solution (the project) will be inefficient, regardless of how well it is managed later.

#### 2.1 Analysis of Market Failures

\[cite\_start]Investment opportunities often arise from analyzing **market failures** or **consumer dissatisfaction**\[cite: 40]. The rigorous identification process requires moving from a perceived symptom to a root cause.

#### 2.2 The Problem Tree (Causal Analysis)

\[cite\_start]The Problem Tree is a methodological tool used to map the causal relationships of a negative situation.

* **The Trunk (Central Problem):** The core negative situation affecting a specific population.
* **The Roots (Causes):** The underlying reasons creating the problem.
* **The Branches (Effects):** The consequences if the problem is not resolved.

#### 2.3 The Objectives Tree (Means-Ends Analysis)

This tool transforms the negative conditions of the Problem Tree into desired positive states\[cite: 40].

* The **Central Problem** becomes the **General Objective**.
* The **Causes** become the **Specific Objectives** (Means).
* The **Effects** become the **Ends** (Goals).

> **Note on Innovation:** For high-uncertainty environments (startups), these traditional methods are often complemented with **Lean Startup** techniques to validate hypotheses about the problem before structuring the entire project.

### 3. Scientific Implementation: Graphviz in Python

While these trees are conceptual, engineering rigour allows us to model them programmatically. This ensures the logical structure is reproducible and easily editable. We will use the `graphviz` library in Python to generate our diagnostic trees.

#### Prerequisites

You must have `graphviz` installed (`pip install graphviz`).

#### Python Code: Generating a Problem Tree

```python
from graphviz import Digraph

def create_problem_tree():
    # Initialize the directed graph
    dot = Digraph(comment='Problem Tree', format='png')
    dot.attr(rankdir='BT') # Bottom-to-Top direction (Roots -> Trunk -> Branches)
    
    # Node Attributes
    dot.attr('node', shape='box', style='filled', fontname='Helvetica')
    
    # 1. Define the Central Problem (The Trunk)
    dot.node('Problem', 'High rate of product defects\n(Central Problem)', color='lightcoral')
    
    # 2. Define Causes (The Roots)
    # Direct Causes
    dot.node('C1', 'Obsolete Machinery', color='lightgrey')
    dot.node('C2', 'Lack of Operator Training', color='lightgrey')
    # Indirect Causes
    dot.node('C1.1', 'Lack of Maintenance Budget', color='white')
    
    # 3. Define Effects (The Branches)
    dot.node('E1', 'Increased Production Costs', color='lightblue')
    dot.node('E2', 'Loss of Customer Trust', color='lightblue')
    
    # 4. Define Relationships (Edges)
    # Roots -> Problem
    dot.edge('C1.1', 'C1')
    dot.edge('C1', 'Problem')
    dot.edge('C2', 'Problem')
    
    # Problem -> Branches
    dot.edge('Problem', 'E1')
    dot.edge('Problem', 'E2')
    
    return dot

# Render the tree
tree = create_problem_tree()
tree.render('output/problem_tree', view=False)
print("Problem Tree generated successfully.")
```
