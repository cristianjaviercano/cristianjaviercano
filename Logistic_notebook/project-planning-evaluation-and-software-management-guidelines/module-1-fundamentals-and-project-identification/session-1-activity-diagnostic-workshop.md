# Session 1 Activity: Diagnostic Workshop

1. **Select a Case:** Identify a specific "market failure" or unsatisfied need in your current industrial environment.
2. **Diagramming:**
   * Construct the Problem Tree identifying at least 3 direct causes and 3 direct effects.
   *   Derive the Objectives Tree, clearly defining the General Objective and Specific Objectives.


3.  **Alternative Identification:** Based on the "Roots" (Means) of the Objectives Tree, propose two mutually exclusive investment alternatives that could solve the problem.
